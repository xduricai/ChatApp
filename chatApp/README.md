## Prerequisites

You will need an installation of npm as well as the angular cli to run this project  
(npm install -g @angular/cli)  
you may also need to run npm install in the chatApp directory to download necessary dependencies  

## Notes  

I decided not to use a separate component for the container holding all person components as to not unnecessarily overcomplicate the implementation  
The use of interfaces was not necessary but they didn't result in too much extra boilerplate so I decided to inclue them anyway, as they could be useful in case additional properties need to be added to them in the future  
I was not sure whether it was expected of me, so I tried to replicate the example provided in the pdf file as closely as possible just to be sure
